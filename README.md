# Commerce Agent

> A conversational AI agent that enables seamless purchasing experiences directly within chat applications like WhatsApp.

This project aims to create a customizable, multi-tenant platform that allows any business to sell its products through a smart, conversational assistant.

## ‚ú® Vision

To make buying from any business in Argentina and beyond as easy and natural as texting a friend.

## üöß Project Status: Proof of Concept (POC)

**This project is currently in the Proof of Concept (POC) phase.**

The primary objective is to validate the core user journey and the proposed technical architecture. The focus is on functionality and learning, not on creating a production-ready application at this stage.

_Last updated: October 2025_

## üéØ POC Goals

The specific goals for this initial version are:

1.  **Validate User Experience:** Prove that users are willing and able to complete a purchase via a chat interface, and that the experience is simple and smooth.
2.  **Technical Feasibility:** Confirm the end-to-end technical flow: `WhatsApp -> AI Service -> Commercetools -> Confirmation`.
3.  **AI Effectiveness:** Test the ability of a Large Language Model (LLM) to act as an effective sales assistant for a limited product catalog.
4.  **Architectural Foundation:** Establish a modular backend that can be extended to other channels (like Telegram) in the future.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project is being built with a modern, scalable stack:

*   **Backend:** TypeScript, Node.js, Fastify
*   **AI / LLM:** LangChain.js, OpenAI / Google Gemini
*   **Commerce Platform:** Commercetools (via `@commercetools/agent-essentials`)
*   **Messaging Platform:** Twilio (for WhatsApp)
*   **Database:** The POC currently uses an in-memory store for conversation history. PostgreSQL is planned for future development.
*   **Containerization:** Docker

## üè¢ Project Structure

This project is a monorepo using npm workspaces.

*   `apps/`: Contains the individual, runnable applications.
    *   `commerce-agent-service`: The main backend service that handles incoming messages and orchestrates the AI agent.
*   `packages/`: Contains shared code, configurations, and utilities.
    *   `typescript-config`: Shared TypeScript configurations for the monorepo.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the development server:**
    From the root of the project, run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command starts the `commerce-agent-service` in development mode with hot-reloading, so it will automatically restart when you make changes to the code.
